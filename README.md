# CS112-Breath-First-Search-Problem

CS112 Distrete Structures assignment problem that uses breadth-first search to calculate the shortest chain of friends from one person to another in a friendship tree.
It also groups students into cliques based off of the college they are affiliated with.

## Project Description

### Shortest Chain

Given two students, name1 and name2, as input, return the shortest chain of friends where name1 knows a chain of friends who also know name2. Return Empty if there is no existing chain.

### Cliques

Given a university as input, return all nodes that are affiliated with that university. For the non‑empty results, order of names within a list does not matter.

### Connectors

Given the graph, return all nodes that that connect two or more nodes together to form a relationship. For the non‑empty results, order of names within a list does not matter.
